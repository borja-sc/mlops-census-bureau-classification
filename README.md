# Income Prediction Machine Learning Model
This GitHub repository contains a machine learning classification model for predicting the level of income based on US census data. The model classifies individuals into two categories: "Below 50k USD" and "Above 50k USD."

## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build and deploy a machine learning model that can predict whether an individual's income is below or above $50,000 based on various features from US census data. In addition to the machine learning model, this repository also includes MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) processes for automatic testing and a live version of the REST API deployed using Render.
